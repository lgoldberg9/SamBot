* "And two weeks ago I saw Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal, and I talked her out of buying this truly heinous angora sweater. Whoever said orange was the new pink was seriously disturbed!"
* "So just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, suddenly I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner, across the street from Aaron Spelling. I think most people would agree that's better than some stinky old Vanderbilt."
* "He's engaged! She's got the six-carat Harry Winston on her bony, unpolished finger."
* "All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs."
* "Bend... and snap!"
* "The rules of hair care are simple and finite. Any Cosmo girl would have known."
* "Exercise gives you endorphins. Endorphins make you happy. Happy people just don't shoot their husbands. They just don't!"
* I'll show you how valuable Elle Woods can be!
* I've been waiting for a long time for you to say that. But if I'm going to be a partner in a law firm by the time I'm 30, I need a boyfriend who's not such a complete bonehead. [Rejects Warner and leaves.]
* [Speaking at the class graduation as valedictorian in Harvard.] On my very first day at Harvard, a very wise professor quoted Aristotle, "the law is reason free from passion!" Well, no offense to Aristotle, but in my three years at Harvard, I have come to find passion is the key ingredient to the study and practice of law, and of life. It is with passion, courage of conviction, and strong sense of self that we take our next steps into the world. Remembering that first impressions are not always correct, you must always have faith in people, and most importantly you must always have faith in yourself. Congratulations Class of 2004, [more excited] we did it.
* Oh, I like your outfit too, except when I dress up as a frigid bitch, I try not to look so constipated.
* These aren't last season!
* He's gay! Enrique is gay!
* Going to Harvard is the only way I'm going to get the love of my life back.

* Well this is so much better than that! Excuse me, I have some shopping to do.
* It wasn't my alibi to tell.
* Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me.
* It's impossible to use a half-loop stitching on low-viscosity rayon. It would snag the fabric. And you didn't just get it in - I saw it in the June Vogue a year ago. So if you're trying to sell it to me for full price, you've picked the wrong girl.
* I promised her, and I can't break the bonds of sisterhood.
* No more boring suits or pantyhose, I'm trying to be somebody I'm not.
* Oh! And it's scented! I think it gives it a little something extra, don't you think? Okay, well, see you next class!
