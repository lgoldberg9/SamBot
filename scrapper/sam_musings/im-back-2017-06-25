As most of my readers can tell, I ended up taking a two-week-or-so break from musing.  Why?  The first week I was reading AP exams [1,2] and found it hard to think about anything besides those exams. The second week was our first annual elementary school "Craft of Code" camp, and after the nine-hour days with kids, I didn't have a lot of energy left for musing.  Perhaps as importantly, because I had fallen out of the habit of posting daily musings, I generally didn't remember. But I've now gotten through two weeks without musing, and I miss it.  So I'm back.  I have a variety of musings planned.  I have at least one left  about reading AP exams.  I should write one on the code camps.  While I was reading AP exams, I took some notes about being an introvert.  Today, as I was working on a variety of tasks, I found my tasks cascading. I'll take notes today and probably finish that one tomorrow.  So, stay tuned for a variety of musings [3]! [1] "Reading" is an alternative term for "grading". [2] And, well, I was really serving as table leader, which meant that I was helping others read AP exams. [3] Feel free to suggest topics, too.
