There are many things at Grinnell that I don't understand.  Some of them are big.  Some of them are small.  Some of them just catch me at odd moments.  Here's one of them. I'm taking students to a conference.  Here's what the student travel guidelines say about student meals.   For conference days when meals are not included with registration, meals can be reimbursed up to $25 per day when original itemized receipts showing specific items purchased are provided [1]. But what do we charge students for meals?  Let's see.  The Dining Services Page says that breakfast is $10, lunch is $12, and dinner is $15.  If I do my math right, that's $37 per day. So, why is the student conference travel meal budget only 2/3 of what it would cost them to eat at Grinnell?   I think I'll ask an Associate Dean [2]. I'll bet it's just as bad for sports teams.  I should ask about that, too [3]. [1] There's more, but the additional stuff does not affect this  confusion. [2] But not today. [3] No, I won't ask an Associate Dean.
