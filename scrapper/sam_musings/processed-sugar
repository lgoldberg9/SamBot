At the end of SIGCSE 2018 [1] a friend mentioned to me that they'd done their best to eliminate processed sugar from their lives.  No cookies. No cake.  No candy.  No soda.  It's not perfect; they accept that they will sometimes have food, like spaghetti sauce, that adds a bit of processed sugar.  But they do the best they can to avoid it, and have been doing so for the past five years. While I love food that involves processed sugar, I know that processed sugar isn't good for me [2]. Hence, I thought I'd see what it would be like to give up sugar.  I've been mostly avoiding processed sugar ever since.  I'm trying to figure out how much of a difference it's making. I haven't been losing weight at a greater rate than I was before. I don't feel substantially different [3,4].  But it's been kind of nice to be able to say to myself "You don't need that cookie; it will break your streak."  I've also realized that I don't really miss cookies, cake, and candies nearly as much as I thought I would.  I also don't miss some sugar-based products that don't start with c's.  I thought I'd miss muffins [5].  I was wrong.  Or at least I've been wrong so far. That's not to say that it's been easy.  I miss the opportunity to have alcoholic drinks based on ginger beer [6,7].  I also know that when I'm sick, syrupy colas and ginger ale often feel really good.  But I think I can do without them.  We were at a really nice Italian restaurant the other night, and it was really hard to say no to tiramisu or the sweetened coffee they offered.  But I still managed to say "no thank you". Are there things that I expect that I expect I will miss more?  Certainly. Ice cream.  Good chocolate.  And it will be a real challenge to say "no" to Laura's trifle or to the Fannie May candy at Easter [9].  However, in the end, something inside me tells me that I'm better off without processed sugar [10], at least for now, and embrace the power and freedom that come with saying "No, I don't do sweets".  Still, it seems strange to make it a permanent decision.  I may revisit the issue in a few months. At some point, I should probably can artificial sweeteners, too.   Postscript: Does real maple syrup count as processed sugar?  At some point, I'll have to decide.  For now, the answer is that I'm not eating pancakes or waffles or french toast. [1] 25 February 2018, if I remember correctly. [2] Corn syrup is even worse. [3] Well, I do feel more tired.  But I don't think the two are related. [4] I didn't feel that much different the first three weeks.  By week four, I began to realize that I felt a bit less hungry each day.  I don't know if the that's related to the sugar, but it may be. [5] Also danishes and donuts. [6] I like ginger beer and tequila, which I think some people call a Jalisco Mule. [7] I don't think I'll be completely sugar free in my drinks.  It's hard to resist an Old Fashioned or a Margarita, for example.  But I haven't had those, either.  Just beer and bourbon [8]. [8] Separately. [9] While I am Jewish, at least culturally, my family is not.  They celebrate Easter, and I join them in the celebrations. [10] And without corn syrup. Version 1.0 released 2018-03-27.
