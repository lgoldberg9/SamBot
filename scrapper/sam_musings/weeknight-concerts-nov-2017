Today I got a postcard from the Jonathan Richman mailing list. JR does not use computers, so I generally hear about concerts through the mailing list [1].  He's playing in Cedar Rapids on November 7. That's a Tuesday night.  I teach early on Wednesday mornings. Sitting on my desk next to the invitation is a flyer for the BoDeans, who are playing in Des Moines on November 9. That's a Thursday night.  I teach early on Friday mornings, too. So, here are the questions [2]. Am I too old to go to weeknight [3] concerns when they are an hour or more away from home? If I'm not too old, can I afford (time, sleep, energy) to go to both? If I only go to one, to which one should I go? Michelle is on call both Tuesday and Thursday.  She likes the BoDeans more than I do.  She always enjoys seeing Jonathan Richman.  Is it fair to go without her? If it's fair to go without her, with whom would I go? [1] I keep thinking someone will set up an email list, but it may be that he doesn't allow it. [2] These are mostly questions for myself.  But if you feel a desire to answer, feel free to do so. [3] Am I the only one who keeps focusing on the "knight" in "weeknight" and then wondering whether it's misspelled?
