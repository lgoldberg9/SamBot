Over the past week or so, I've heard two nearly opposite descriptions of what it's like to work with me.  I've heard that I am inappropriately relentless.  I've heard that people dread getting email or letters from me.  But I've also heard that I'm valued partner [1] and that I bring a positive attitude and smile to what I do. So, why do people experience me so differently?  I'm the same person in all cases.  I've been just as "relentless" with the people who consider me a valued partner as those who dread hearing from me.  As I reflect on the question, I think there are at least two issues at hand.  First, it may be that I don't share values with some of the people who dread hearing from me.  For whatever reason, I value different things about the College or the world than they do.  One clear difference is that I seem to care more about precision in language than others.  Second, it may be that these people don't understand that most of what I complain about, I complain about for the benefit of the students and institution I so highly value. Alternately, why do people consider me a "valued partner"?  Probably because I do work hard to make the College better and I do try to support colleagues in the work they do.  Folks in a wide variety of offices on campus work hard for our students, and I appreciate it. Why do the two sets of people view me differently?  I'll probably never understand. [1] I've been called a valued partner by at least four different offices on campus in the past week or so.
