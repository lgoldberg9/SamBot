Dear Sam [1], Given your recent essay on your difficulty setting up course sites, I expect that you are still a bit behind.  You've been a good and diligent writer for these past few months, so I give you permission to make tonight's essay a short note to yourself, exempting you from having to write a longer essay. Good luck on catching up!  I look forward to encouraging you to write about the new course sites [3], about your start-of-semester mid-career reflections with the legendary Karla Erickson, about the large number of people in the queue of Grinnellians to write about [4], and so much more.  But for now, I think you should focus on your classes and your paperwork. Sincerely, Your Muse p.s. Sorry that I still encouraged you to write too many endnotes.  At least they are short. [1] Alternately: SamR, or S.A [2], or Rebelsky, or Samwise, or Spamwise, or DPR2, or Alex, whatever you're calling yourself this week. [2] Which you seem to pronounce "essay". [3] Once they are built. [4] Including Karla [5]! [5] And the other Karla, too!
