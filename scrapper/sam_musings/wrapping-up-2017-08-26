I spent a week not having time to muse.  I spent today musing.  I wrote five other musings, including the introductory musing that explained why there was a missing week.  You know what? It felt good.  I like writing.  I like thinking about how to organize ideas and words.  I like the occasional (and not so occasional) rants that come out.  I like what I learn when I write. But it's time to wrap up. Don't worry.  I'm not wrapping up the musings [1].  I'm just wrapping up for the day.  I look forward to continuing to find the time to muse. I hope that you look forward to continuing to read what I write.
