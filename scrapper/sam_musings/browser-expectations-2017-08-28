Today I received an email message about our switch from Formstack [1] to Qualtrics [2].  That message suggested that I read our new survey policy and contained a link to the policy [3].  Of course, because it's GrinCo, I couldn't read the document.  Instead, I got an error message   There's a configuration problem preventing us from getting your document.  If possible, try opening this document in Microsoft Word. Of course, since I didn't have the document, only the link, so there was no way to try opening it in Word.  I did request a copy.  The response included not only the document also a suggestion that I should just check directly at the policy center [4].  I didn't know that we had a Policy Center on GrinCo.  Time to check it out. What's the first thing I see at the policy center?   ** DO NOT USE GOOGLE CHROME FOR WORKING IN THE POLICY CENTER ** PLEASE USE INTERNET EXPLORER ** Um ... Isn't Internet Explorer being discontinued, even on Windows? There also hasn't been an Internet Explorer for over four years and I don't think there's ever been an Internet Explorer for Linux.  Does that mean the policies don't apply to MacOs and Linux users? More seriously, though.  Why should our policy center expect a particular browser [5]? [1] Easy to use form builder.  Not FERPA compliant. [2] I have no idea whether or not it's easy to use.  I do assume it's FERPA compliant.

[4] No link included.  I found it at https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/President/PolicyCenter/SitePages/Home.aspx. [5] And why are our policies behind a password wall?
