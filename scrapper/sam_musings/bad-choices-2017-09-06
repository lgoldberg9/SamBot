Tuesday night at 9:00 p.m. or so, I was trying to write a homework assignment and a reading for CSC 151.  But I was falling asleep at the keyboard.  I thought about taking a nap.  Michelle said something  like "Why don't you go to sleep now, get up at 5:00 a.m., and do the work then."  It sounded like a good idea.  And I was asleep in bed five minutes later, plus or minus.  I even woke up before my alarm went off at 5:05 a.m. Fortunately, my co-teacher had written the homework assignment, so I just had a few quick edits.  But ... by the time I dealt with all of my email and had prepared my classes for the day, it was 8:30 a.m. and time to teach class.  So I didn't get the writing done or my musings done or, well, anything other than email and class prep.  But I got sleep. So, did I make a good choice or a bad choice?
