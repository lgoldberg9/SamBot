I started writing the next episode of "Nibbled to death by ducks" today. I also have to write lots of things for our department retreat [1]. And I wanted to think about a paper on the code camp.  But I'm exhausted. I don't think I should even spend the time to finish that episode, particularly given how sad it will make me and that the other tasks need my time more.  My students also seem to be getting sick.  So, off to bed. More musings tomorrow, maybe [2]. [1] More explanation is in that episode. [2] I probably shouldn't have written five separate musings yesterday.  Then I could have saved some for today and tomorrow.
