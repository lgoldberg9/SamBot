Tonight was not a good night for writing.   I thought about working on one of two rants, one about Codecademy and one about another issue.  However, at the end of the week, I don't have the mental energy for a significant rant. I started two or three musings,  But I wasn't able to finish any of them. I'm not even sure that I can finish this one. I'll try again tomorrow.
