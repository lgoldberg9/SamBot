Sam, you're almost at three-hundred and sixty-five musings.  Do you plan to do something special for your one-year anniversary? Yes. What? I'm not sure sure yet. But isn't this your one-year anniversary? I'm going for one year of nearly-continuous daily musings.  Since I didn't muse in summer 2016, the year starts from September 1, 2016 and will complete on August 31, 2017.  Plan for a musing then. Wow, that's a let down. Sorry.  At least you'll get some more musings in the mean time. Aren't you worried that you will be incredibly busy on August 31? Yes.
