I know that our department is loved and appreciated because a group of alums has started a campaign to endow a chair in CS.  When last I heard, it cost $2 million to endow a chair.  I thought that was a lot. Then I talked to Development and Alumni Relations [1].  It appears the price tag has gone up twice since I talked to them.  It now costs $3 million to endow a chair for an existing position and $5 million to endow a chair that accompanies a new position [2]. I really appreciate our alumni efforts.  However, I see no way that they'll come up with that much money.  $5 million is far into "rich old alum" and "corporate sponsor" leagues. For those prices, I hope that the positions come with better stoles than  current ones [3]. [1] DAR.  Not to be confused with Daughters of the American Revolution or Youngest Son.
