I've fallen into a normal schedule for my time grading the AP exam. I wake up at 6:30 a.m., shower, and walk over to the convention center. I eat breakfast with other folks.  We're in the room reading exams from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. with a few breaks.  As a Table Leader, I'm there until 5:30 p.m. to debrief.  I have dinner and then some evening event. And I'm back in bed by about 10:30 p.m. What does that mean?  It means that I'm tired when it's time to muse and can't necessarily think deep thoughts [1].  It means that all I'm thinking about right now is AP CS Principles.  But I'm not supposed to write anything public about AP CS Principles [2].  That makes it hard to find anything to muse about.  Maybe I'll find a way to take a break some time soon. Or maybe I'll find a tangent to go off on.  We'll see. [1] It's not clear that I can ever think deep thoughts, but that's a separate issue. [2] Don't worry, I'm ranting about AP CS Principles.  I'm just doing so in private [3]. [3] No, I won't give you a clue about what I'm ranting about.
