My family. My family [1]. My health. My friends. My students [2,3]. These essays. Everything else [4]. I'm behind enough on sleep that I almost fell asleep at the diving competition today and nodded off during the fascinating Grinnell lecture [5].  I've been dealing with cold-like symptoms for most of the week.  I think I've answered all the recent questions I've received from students.  I have forty exams and forty quizzes to grade this weekend.  I therefore sacrifice tonight's essay for the greater good [6]. [1] Yes, they are important enough that they should be listed twice. [2] That's intended as broad, and includes not just students in my classes, but the students who use me as a sounding board, the students who ask me for advice, and more. [3] "My students" also includes things like class prep, grading, and such. [4] I probably missed something that should go between some of the categories above.  I'm just not sure what it is. [5] It really was fascinating; Leslie Lyons is awesome. [6] I suppose I could have tried the approach I tried in English in high school.  We were supposed to journal for a page each day.  I wrote my history notes in stanza form, and turned those in, claiming that I was writing poetry.  I think it worked for over a month.
