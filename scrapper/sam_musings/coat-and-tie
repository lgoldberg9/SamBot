Every five or so years, I decide to wear a sport coat and tie to work each day.  There's usually no particular motivating factor; something in my brain says "You should wear a coat and a tie."  I like ties; I can wear bright and flashy things [1] and I get to cut off the flow of oxygen to my brain [2].  I find life more pleasant that way. I'm always interested to hear how people react.  "Are you meeting with someone?" "Nope, I just decided to wear a coat and tie."  "Why are you wearing a suit?"  "I'm not.  It's a sport coat [3]." "What's the special occasion?" "There isn't one." Best of all, "My, you look dapper today." That seems to be the wrong d-word.  I'm pretty sure that I'm just differently disheveled. [1] I like ties with complex and non-regular patterns. [2] At least that's what I claim. [3] I don't claim to understand the terminology for women's fashion; I shouldn't be surprised that others don't know the terminology for mine.
