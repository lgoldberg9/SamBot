I was recently doing a set of interviews and trying to schedule times for those interviews.  There were multiple interviewers, so in sending each email message, I signed it with all the interviewer names and I carbon copied the other interviewers.  Amazingly, none of the people being interviewed thought that it was appropriate to do "reply all"; they all replied just to me.  Of course, in writing back, I re-added my fellow interviewers to the recipient list.  And when the interviewees wrote back, they again replied only to me. I was annoyed, but I'm often annoyed.  I didn't bring the issue up, but when we were debriefing at the end of the interviews, one of my fellow interviewers said something like "I can't believe that none of these people knew to reply all on something like this." In contrast, I also see times when people reply to all when they should not.  Most frequently, that has to do with a mailing list.  Someone wants to reply to the person posting, but not the whole list.  But they choose "reply to all" and everyone gets to see the personal message [1,6].  But I've seen many other instances.  I've had cases in which there has been a casual discussion about an issue among a small group of people (e.g., faculty and students) and then someone sends a reply to all that includes information that only a smaller group should see.  There are times that someone sends a message to all the science faculty (e.g., "Are you giving a final?") and someone decides to tell everyone their answer (e.g., "Yes.").  All of these situations irritate me. I can't claim that I'm completely innocent of either behavior, but I generally do my best to pay attention to who my messages are going and to reflect on whether that is the appropriate group of recipients [7]. I wish others would, too [8]. Oh well, I'm sure that the next version of Proofpoint will automate that task for us [9]. [1] For some reason, Grinnell often sets Lyris [2] lists to use the list as the default reply-to address.  I understand that people don't necessarily notice that behavior, since it's not typical behavior [5]. I'm ranting about the cases in which the message goes to both the sender and to the list. [2] Lyris is a mailing list manager, akin to Listserv and Mailman.  It differs in that it doesn't provide an archive to subscribers.  It's also harder to manage than Listserv [3].  I have no idea why we chose it [4]. [3] I manage both Lyris lists and Listserv lists.  I'd much rather use Listserv. [4] I have no idea why we choose most of the software we choose.  In many cases, the reason seems to be "others do it". [5] Yeah, that's another wonderful feature of Lyris. [6] Okay, not always everyone.  On the lists I moderate, I do my best to catch personal messages and delete them.  So only the other moderator and I see them. [7] I will admit that I too often engage in the less appropriate behavior of adding more recipients, particularly when I send a ranting reply. [8] I don't wish that others would add more recipients; I wish that they would be thoughtful about who they include in replies.  There are times that you should reply all; there are times you should reply only to the sender; there are times that you should reply to a subset of the recipients; and there are times you should add a few selected other folks. [9] Since this is written, and not spoken, I should note that that final sentence is intended to be sarcastic [10]. [10] Since my sarcasm usually needs to be explained, I'll note that the College has decided that people on campus can't be trusted to decide  whether or not a link is real or fake, and so use Proofpoint to check for us.
