I'm behind on sleep, and tired enough that I fell asleep during Convocation on Thursday [1].  I usually use weekends to catch up on sleep.  I got up at 5:30 a.m. this morning.  I drove for about six hours.  It's now the first time I've been at my computer, and it's about 10 p.m.  I will probably  get up at 6:30 a.m. tomorrow, and I have five hours to drive tomorrow [2]. My choices are (a) write an extended essay of the day or (b) write a short reflection and go to bed. I'm going to make the good choice [3]. Dear readers, I will be back on Sunday night. [1] No jokes permitted from my former tutorial students. [2] Whine, whine, whine. [3] Given that I got the Markdown incorrect for the link from the index page, it's definitely the right choice [4]. [4] Given that I couldn't even spell "right" correctly, it's certainly the right choice.
