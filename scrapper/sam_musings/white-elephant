Sam, you care deeply about people and about the state of the world. Why aren't you writing about the obvious issues? Any time I read the newspaper or listen to the news, I feel depressed and hopeless.  I have no desire to write about these issues and feel more so.  I am, however, encouraged by the activism of our students and many of my colleagues. Did you enjoy the mixed metaphor?  If you're not sure what "the elephant in the room" or a "white elephant" are, I'm sure Bingle-ing the InterWeb will help.   I suppose I could have done better by doing something with the parable of the blind men and the elephant.  However, as I noted, writing more about these issues just makes me feel worse.   I sincerely appreciate those of you who are taking an active role in trying to make a difference.  I hope that I do my part by supporting you as people. This "essay" has no endnotes.  Deal.  And yes, they are endnotes, not  footnotes.
