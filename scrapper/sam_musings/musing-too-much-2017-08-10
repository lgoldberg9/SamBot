I started musing about Sedona [1] tonight.  I also promised Michelle that I would come to bed by about 10:00 p.m., since I have not been getting enough sleep.  Amazingly, those two goals conflict.  I have now written 1600 words about Sedona and I'm only about half way through the musing, particularly because I'm discovering even more annoying flaws [2] as I try to explain it to the uninitiated. I don't like posting half-written musings.  I don't like posting unedited musings [3].  I hate Sedona [7].  I'm out of time.  When you put all of that together you get, well, this musing. Stay tuned for a longer musing tomorrow. [1] Sedona is a much-reviled software system for recording faculty activities.  Stay tuned for a longer explanation. [2] For example, I've discovered some strange effects when I make a copy of a service entry and then edit the copy.  I need to document them more clearly and then submit a bug report. [3] Yeah, that probably surprises most readers.  Perhaps I should rephrase that as "I don't like posting musings that I haven't read through at least once after spewing them out [4]." [4] "Spewing them out" is my less-positive term for "free writing" [5]. [5] It's not really fair to call what I do "free writing", even though I don't charge, because I have been known to go back and forth in the midst of writing, rather than trying to get everything down at once [6]. [6] Even in a musing as short as this one, I ended up going back and adding two endnotes at the beginning. [7] I'm not sure that's relevant, but I was already saying "I don't like" about different things, so it seemed appropriate.
