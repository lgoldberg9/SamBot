I wrote a longish rant about a campus issue this morning.  It felt good. I drew upon the wounds of repeated slights [1] to comment vociferously on a more recent slight [2].  But I tried to be rational.  Instead of posting it immediately [3], I decided to run it by a few valued colleagues to get their feedback on it.  One of them wrote the following [4].   Sam, your rant effectively targets two staff members.  Have you put   yourself in their place?  Here are some things you might think about   .... My colleague was correct.  I had not put myself in their place and I should have.  When I did, I realized that I was not being fair. The situation was one that I did not like, it reflected an experience that I've had multiple times, but it wasn't really the fault of these two staff members.  So, as is sometimes the case, I have decided not to post today's musing [5].  And perhaps I'll learn to think more about the position of the other before I rant about them [8]. [1] The slights I suffer as a computer scientist are generally not nearly as bad as the microagressions folks suffer for their perceived race or gender or other identity.  But they do build up. [2] Well, perceived slight. [3] Or waiting until tonight, revising slightly, and then posting. [4] Okay, they didn't say exactly the following.  But it's a close enough paraphrase. [5] Or at least that one.  Today may be a multiple musing day [6]. [6] Nope.  I didn't finish the second one [7]. [7] More precisely, I didn't finish the work that I was trying to describe in the second one, which makes it difficult to finish that musing. [8] Should I do the same for administrators?  We'll see.  It would help if I didn't get yet another painful data set today.
