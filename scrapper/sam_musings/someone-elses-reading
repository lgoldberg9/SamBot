Today I had a strange experience.  I learned that one of my musings is required reading for Lighting the Page, Erik Simpson's innovative course on literature and literary analysis in the digital age [1]. I'm used to having students read what I write.  After all, I've written large portions of the readings for Grinnell's CSC 151.  And the musing that Erik assigned is essentially a form of one of the readings for that course. I also assign Erik's work in my own classes, particularly the oft-cited "Five ways of looking at a thesis" [2].  So it seems only fair that Erik assigns my work [3]. But it's still strange to be assigned in a non-CS course.  I'm not even sure how Erik plans to use the piece.  Fortunately, I have a conflicting engagement the day that piece is due. Postscript: When I followed the link from Erik's site, I immediately noticed a typo.  I fixed that one.  I wonder how many more there are. [1] One of the privileges of my position is that I can sometimes sit in on colleagues' classes.  I don't often have time to do so, but when I can, it's a great experience.  I'll write more about that privilege in a future musing. [2] HTML version available at https://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~simpsone/Connections/Writing/Thesis/fiveway1.html. [3] I doubt that "A computer scientist's perspective on introductory data science" will ever be linked as much as "Five Ways". I certainly didn't put as much Goldmanesque creativity into my piece. Perhaps I need a sequel that builds on The Princess Bride; maybe I could write about a distant reading of that text [4,5]. [4] Or the missing chapter(s). [5] That seems like an excellent project for my fall fellowship.
