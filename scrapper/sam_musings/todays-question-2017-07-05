Yesterday, during Grinnell's annual 4th of July parade, a number of us noted that the van from one of the real estate companies in town had a picture of the John Chrystal Center [1], as well as the Grinnell College stone wall in front of the JCC [3], on its side.  Today's question is: Why? More precisely,    Why is there a picture of the JCC on a real estate van? Fortunately, Dean Latham was a few people over from me.  I assumed he'd have an answer.  But Dean Latham was as puzzled as the rest of us. Here are the answers I've proposed [4]. Grinnell has purchased a real-estate agency [5]. We've realized that the budget won't cover the balloon payment  on the Bear [6] and so we have to sell the JCC to make up the difference. We've decided to raise funds by selling Grinnell's identity to local merchants. It's part of a broader pattern of selling Grinnell property. We're selling Ricker House through one real-estate agent and want to sell the Chrystal center through another one. They are selling the JCC, but it will have to be moved, just like the language houses. Cornell is selling a building and the real estate company got confused as to which school contracted with them. I tried to convince Dean Latham that the funds we raised through such a venture could cover a number of additional faculty lines.  He didn't bite. What's your answer? [1] Or "Nord's folly", as I like to call it [2]. [2] Actually, there are enough things I call "Nord's folly" that I should probably number them.  Let's call the JCC "Nord's folly #23". [3] In case you couldn't tell, "JCC' is short for "John Chrystal Center". [4] Well, some other folks suggested at least one of of these answers. [5] Or partial interest in a real-estate agency. [6] Nord's folly #27 [7]. [7] The folly is the bonds issued to purchase the Bear, not the Bear itself [8]. [8] Issuing bonds is not a folly.  Grinnell's Triple-Eh rating means that we generally pay less interest on our bonds than we make from our investments.  Building something the cost of the Bear without fundraising a significant amount first is a bit of a folly, particularly since the assumption was that we could retroactively fundraise.
