I've been grading student project proposals all evening [1].  It's past my bedtime.  I haven't finished grading them.  Should I stop?  I know that I need rest.  But here's the question: If I don't grade them tonight, when can I grade them?  Let's see ...  Tomorrow is Thursday. What's my schedule? 8:00 a.m. Teach CSC 282.  [2] 9:00 a.m. Run review session for CSC 151.  That's informal, but I do need to be there and talk during it. 10:00 a.m. Meet with my TEC 395 students to see how their project is going. 11:00 a.m. Meet with my summer research students to look ahead to the summer and plan for their MAP Part A forms [3]. Noon.  Lunch with the SEPC.  At least I can do two things at once. 1:00 p.m. Office hours.  I believe I have students booked non-stop until 3:00 p.m., since this is the last day of pre-registration. 3:00 p.m. Plan the next CSC 151 exam with the teacher of the other section.  Also discuss recent class observations. 4:00 p.m. Informal chatter in the commons [4]. 4:15 p.m. A cool talk by the Project Gadfly crowd. 5:15 p.m. Go watch youngest son play tennis [5]. 7:30 p.m. Normal end-time for tennis.  Feed youngest. Hmmm ... I'm not sure when I'll have time to read email, let alone get more grading done.  I should design a better schedule for myself!   At least this musing was quick enough that I have time to grade one or two more proposals before I fall asleep at my desk [6]. [1] At some point, I need to muse about why I don't like grading rubrics for the proposals.  But not tonight, since I still have proposals left to grade. [2] Damn!  I still need to get that prepared. [3] I should print some of those. [4] No, I don't normally schedule informal chatter.  I just note that we have pre-talk chatter on Thursday. [5] Part of me thinks that I should miss the Gadfly talk to see him play more tennis.  But he'll be playing again on Friday. [6] Or maybe to think more carefully about 282 in the morning.
