Whenever I drive north on I-35 from Missouri to Iowa, it feels like there's a point at which my estimated arrival time home increases [1]. The latest time I drove home from Kansas City, I decided to pay closer attention. When there was a sign that said "Des Moines: 123 miles", I reset my trip meter.  When the next sign said "Des Moines: 100 miles", my trip meter said "23 miles".  I don't remember what the next sign said [2], but the total was still 123 miles.   Then we crossed the border from Missouri to Iowa.  The first sign in Iowa said "Des Moines: 80 miles".  I looked down at the trip meter. It said that I had traveled 53 miles since resetting the meter.   Um ... why did the distance suddenly increase by ten miles? Hypthoses: I wasn't paying close enough attention.  Doubtful.  I really wanted to see when my estimates changed and why. Missouri and Iowa think of "Des Moines" as being in different places, or choose different places in the city.  Doubtful.  Mile markers traditionally use the central post office. The sign makers in Missouri got confused.  Unlikely. A warp in the weft of the universe.  Highly unlikely. So, what next?  Two requests to my readers. If you drive north on I-35 from Missouri to Des Moines, please repeat my experiment to see if you have the same experience of losing ten miles. If you have recommendations on who, if anyone, I might resport this discrepancy to, please let me know.  (My assumption is MOdot, but I'm not really sure what I say.) [1] That's my mental estimate, not the Google maps estimate.  I'm generally not running Google maps while driving home. [2] I recall 85 miles, but I didn't write it down.
