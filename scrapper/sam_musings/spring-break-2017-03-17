It's spring break.  It should be a time for me to relax, enjoy time with my family, get some extra sleep, catch up on work a bit, and more.  I was going to write about all of the things I planned to do during break, such as finally reading Getting Things Done, finishing grading the second  exam in CSC 151, writing a proposal for a tenure-track position, and more [1].  I was particularly looking forward to avoiding the shit I've been dealing with this past week.  I knew I'd have to come back to it after break, but a break would have been good. However, to paraphrase one of my Iowa friends, "If you try to put ten pounds of manure in a five-pound sack, something's gotta give." I got to deal with things tonight, when I could have been relaxing or writing an essay.  It sounds like I am going to have to spend at least one day of break [2] dealing with overflow, as it were.  It might not be so bad if I knew everything would be done by the end of break, but there are things that can't be done until after break.  So I'll be dealing with the overflowing sack for a few weeks after that.  And I'm crossing my fingers that I don't have more horses [3,4] adding to the bag. I hope that I can get it all cleaned up before Jerod becomes chair. [1] You can see some of my plans in my essay on mid-semester planning. [2] Probably more. [3] Or portions thereof. [4] By the way, good luck to our Equestrian Team during break [5]! [5] Good luck to Ultimate, Baseball, and other teams, too [6]. [6] Also Grinnell Singers, who are touring the midwest.  See their show if you can!
