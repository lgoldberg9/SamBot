Being at Grinnell has given me the good fortune to get to know a variety of incredibly awesome people: colleagues [1], friends, alumni, students, and even some folks who cross those boundaries.  One of the privileges of my position is that I can occasionally connect students to these people and they provide the students with guidance, advice, a sounding board, or other kinds of support [2]. Once in a while, I also notice connections when both sides can provide and receive support.  In those cases, I typically send a short note. "A, meet B.  B, meet A.  A is [fill in Sam's description of A].  B is [fill in Sam's description of B].  You two seem to share common interests. You should talk." I love when that approach works really well.  About a month ago, I suggested that two of my favorite "empowerment" people [3] meet. The met face to face a week or so ago.  Both thanked me profusely the next day.   I can't wait to see what they come up with together. [1] I count both faculty and staff as colleagues and find awesomeness in both categories. [2] Unfortunately, not all students understand what a privilege this kind of connection can be, and abuse the opportunity, so I've become a bit more cautious about making general connections.  I plan to work with one of my thoughtful colleagues in CLS to help better prepare students for making connections. [3] When I describe them as "empowerment" people, I mean that I think of both as particularly successful at empowering others to achieve their goals. Both also empower me.
