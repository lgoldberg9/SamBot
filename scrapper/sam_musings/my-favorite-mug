More than 30 years ago, I bought the mug that is my favorite.  It's a style that was popular then - a much wider base than lip, which means that it does not spill easily.  But that's not why I like it.  I like it because of what's on the mug. The mug comes from The University of Chicago Divinity School Coffee Shop [1].  It's black with white lettering.  One side says "Divinity School Coffee Shop", or something similar.  The other side says "Where God Drinks Coffee" [2].  The mug does a great job of capturing the self-concept of UofC [3]; you know the implication is that God would drink coffee there because of the opportunity for stimulating conversations.  As a UofC grad, I believe that the conceit is true. Unfortunately, even though the mug is tip proof, it is not knock-off-desk-proof.  And so, a few years ago, the handle broke [4]. I didn't throw it away; it's too important to me to do so.  I tried to get a replacement.  Unfortunately, they don't make 'em like they used to. The new ones don't have the same impact$ the font is different and they certainly don't have the shape [5]. So my favorite mug is a non-usable mug.  That's probably symbolic of something. Postscript: I tried to find a photo of a similar mug online.  I failed. Maybe I'll add one to this musing later. [1] I'm not exactly sure of the ordering; it may be the "The Coffee Shop of The University of Chicago Divinity School" or even "The Coffee Shop in the Divinity School at the University of Chicago." [2] I'd prefer that it said "Where G-D Drinks Coffee", but you can' have everything. [3] It was UofC when I was there.  The whole UChicago thing comes from domain naming. [4] Or, more precisely, I knocked the mug off my desk and broke the handle. [5] I last looked a few years ago.  I see that the coffee shop has now been renamed to Grounds of Being. It's definitely not the same thing.
