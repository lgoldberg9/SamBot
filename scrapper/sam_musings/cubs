This essay was posted in the bottom of the fourth of game 2 of the 2016 World Series. As my readers may know, I lived in Chicago for about a dozen years. I'm not much of a baseball fan, but it's hard to live in Chicago and not think about the Cubs (and the White Sox) [5].  Living in Chicago brings with it lots of Cubs stories, or Wrigley field stories, such as the legendary Disco record inferno [6]. Anyway, I'm not sure when or how I came to believe this, but at some point I became convinced that the world would end when the Cubs win the World Series.  (I don't think I'm alone in believing this; it's probably a belief that someone shared with me. I just don't remember who.) It's not a belief that guides my life in any way.  But, I'll admit, there have been times that I appreciated the many curses that seem to have been laid on the Cubbies [9]. But now the Cubs are in the World Series.  And yes, I'm rooting for them [10].  Will they win it all?  I hope so.  Will the world end?  Maybe, but it will be worth it. Of course, I also believed that the world would end when the Sox [11] won the World Series, and I was wrong about that. Am I deterred by the Cubs loss in game 1?  Nah. Do I believe that a real baseball fan, like Erik Simpson, would write a much better essay?  Certainly. [1] I mean "nigh" and not "night".  It means "near", but sounds cooler. [2] I seem to have answered the question: "Can you rationally have a reference to an endnote [3] before the first paragraph?"  It appears the answer is "Yes."  Our next question is: "Can you rationally have a reference to an endnote before the first word in an essay?"  We will explore that question in a future essay. [3] I originally wrote "Can you rationally [4] have an endnote before the first paragraph?"  However, that's not a good question, since the endnote appears at the end.  "a reference to an endnote" is more precise. [4] Actually, I originally wrote "Can you have an endnote before the first paragraph?"  However, the answer to that is obviously "Yes, although it may not make any sense." [5] The Sox, with no modifier, can only refer to the Red Sox. [6] I'm told that I am wrong, and it happened at Comiskey Park [7].  I'm leaving my incorrect statement in the essay, and this correction here. [7] Comiskey Park (or perhaps some monstrosity built in the same location) is now known as U.S. Cellular Field. [8] No, not really.  I generally prefer to see the Cubs win [9]. [9] Or, more precisely, to hear that the Cubs won. [10] While I like the concept of a small-town team like Cleveland winning, their logo is unbearable. [11] Red [12]. [12] And yes, I know that the non-Red Sox also won a World Series this millenium.
