I seem to be in a cycle of lack-of sleep.  Here's how it goes! I don't get enough sleep. I'm tired, so I make poor decisions, such as deciding to write three musings in one evening. Those poor decisions mean that I stay up late. Staying up later leads me to get less sleep. Isn't that a wonderful cycle? In any case, I need more sleep.  I have enough stresses in my life that I need to be rested enough to deal with them. Good night.
