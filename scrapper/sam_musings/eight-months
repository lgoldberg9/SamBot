It's the last day of the month.  On the last day of each month, I do my best to reflect back on what I've written and learned about writing in the past month.  In the first few months, I found myself developing or refining my style [1].  Yet it is not clear that the style or the quality of my writing has changed significantly after those first few months [2]. My prose remains workmanlike.  I continue to release musings that need more editing [3].  I continue to make pointless jokes throughout each musing [4]. So, what has happened in this past month?  About a week ago, I decided to stop titling these "essay of the day", at least when I post them to Twitter or Facebook.  I called the series "musings" at the beginning for a reason, and I'm going back to that term.  I'm not sure whether I'll revise the indices to say "Musing" rather than "Essay", but the possibility exists [5]. I did hit one of my biggest sets of struggles this semester.  First, I didn't have access to the Internet and was working too hard on other things, so I didn't get essays developed to their normal state for a few days and ended up posting five essays at once.  The "skip a day or two and then make it up" pattern happened in the first round of forty or so essays and ended up foreshadowing the summer-long stoppage. I'd prefer not to stop. Given that preference, I was unhappy to find that I had writer's block for a few days when I returned [6].  I pressed through it, because I've committed to writing something and because any writing is better than no writing.  But I'm still not sure that it's gone.  I had trouble writing the essay on international CS majors, which is strange given how much I appreciate those students.  I'm finding it a bit harder to come up with topics that are of general interest.  As I look back over the month, I see that I even had writer's block earlier in the month.  That is certainly not a good sign. I worry that in writing these musings, I am increasingly focusing inward, rather than outward.  I'd like to find more occasions in which I naturally write things that will be of use to prospective students, or current students, or whoever [7].  So maybe my writing has changed in that I have ended up writing introspectively [8].  I don't think I like the change. Perhaps I worry too much.  I see that I wrote a few pieces that I consider useful, such as the commentary on tipping hotel housekeeping and the draft SEPC handbook [11].  I wrote about a strange teaching practice that it sounds like some folks may adapt.  I even provided helpful guidance for employment seekers I've also started to play with writing tools.  I process most of these musings [12] through Grammarly and the Hemingway Editor [14].  I tried Grammarly premium and gave up on it because it gave incorrect advice, and I don't want to pay that much for incorrect advice [17].  Nonetheless, because I use these tools, I end up looking at my writing more closely. At times, I wonder whether I might be equally well served by a tool that highlights random sentences and asks, "Are you sure you've said this as well as you can?"  In any case, I wonder if anyone notices that I have edited these essays more carefully than before?  I don't. I have also been writing a number of pieces that I am not comfortable posting.  During break, I wrote: a recommendation letter or two, which I definitely should not post; two position proposals, which would also be inappropriate to post; an explanatory document for a proposal before the Grinnell faculty, which should stay within the faculty; a draft of an external review, which I certainly should not post; some paper and scholarship reviews, which are confidential; and a response to the Dean's latest questions on the "research opportunities for all" initiative, which I posted. I also wrote a bunch [18] of email messages. I did not achieve much of the writing I intended for this series. I had expected to write more profiles.  I did not write them.  I had expected to write more essays on C and Unix.  I wrote a few, but not many. So, while I might benefit from making a plan on what kinds of writing to work on in the coming month, the odds are high that I would fail to achieve that plan.  I could try a new genre, such as book reviews. I could try poetry [19].  I had considered fiction, but that's more appropriate for NaNoWriMo [20]. Maybe I'll go back to ranting about assorted things.  That seems like an appropriate approach for a curmudgeon like me who is old, fat, tired, and grumpy.  I know that a reasonably large subset of my readers enjoys those rants.  But I'm not sure that it sets a good example for my readers. We'll see.  Check back with me in a month [21]. [1] Yes, endnotes are part of the style. [2] Some of my readers may wish to dispute that claim. [3] All of my writing almost certainly needs more editing. [4] Yes, I realize that most of you couldn't tell. [5] I am not sure how I feel about revisionist history. [6] Or, as I phrased it, my muse seemed to have disappeared for spring break. [7] I do realize that the C and Linux writings can serve a useful purpose. But I'd like to go beyond those. [8] Yes, I realize that my end-of-month musings are always introspective. I also realize that a fraction of my musings are also introspective [9].  I worry that the fraction has been increasing. [9] Grammarly suggests that I should write "fraction ... is" rather than "fraction ... are".  But the fraction still represents multiple items. The answer may appear in CMOS [10].  I should keep a copy at home. [10] The Chicago Manual of Style, not a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor. [11] I should discuss that draft handbook with the SEPC when they return. [12] I'm working hard to maintain the old/new terminology. [14] The Hemingway editor told me that this musing had 39 adverbs when I first submitted it and that I should aim for twelve [15].  But it  counts "Grammarly" as an adverb, so the count is high.  Oh well, at least I only used the passive voice once, and that is in the disclaimer that "Sam's Assorted Musings / Reflections: Eight months of daily musings by Samuel A. Rebelsky is licensed under a  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License [16]." [15] By the time I decided that I was done editing, I was down to thirty adverbs and the Hemingway editor generously told me that I should aim for thirteen.  Of course, I added this endnote, which also added another adverb. [16] Whoops!  Now I have used the passive voice twice. [17] I plan to write a separate essay on Grammarly. [18] Hmmm ... What's the appropriate collective for email messages? I used "bunch", but that's usually associated with bananas.  I could write "a lot of email messages", but that's not all that interesting. I suppose "flurry" would work, since I often sent a lot at once.  But I sent messages over multiple days, so perhaps I should use "flurries". If I used profanity, I suppose I could say "a load of email messages", or a variant thereof.  I'll consider using "flurries" in the future. [19] No. [20] NaNoWriMo is "National Novel Writing Month".  It is an opportunity for large numbers of people to write long pieces that very few people  will read. [21] Or, preferably, read along each day and form your own opinion.
