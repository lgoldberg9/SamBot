I'm wrapping up preregistration and only have a few students left to register.  One of my more challenging students sent me a message something like the following [1].   Dear Professor [2], I realize that you think I should take a course in the Humanities next semester.  I was planning to take [name of course] [3].  However, it is not offered next semester.  I will plan to take it my senior year. In addition, in my remaining three semesters I have to take four courses for [other major], four courses for my CS major, and two courses for my [name of concentration] concentration.  I'd also like to take [course that seems related to the two majors] [4]. What was my reaction? First, I wondered how we could have ended up in a situation in which the student needed eight courses for two majors in three semesters.  There are some complications that led to the situation which are inappropriate to discuss in a musing [5].   Next, I wondered why we allowed the student to add a concentration [6] on top of that. Then I realized: I never approved that concentration.  So I checked the concentration declaration form [9].  Lo and behold, although the concentration advisor has to sign the form, the major advisor does not [10].  So, even though I'd been trying to step back from worrying about things [11], I composed a note to Curriculum Committee. Dear Curriculum Committee Members, This semester, I've been getting pushback from a lot of students who say "I can't take X because I need to finish the requirements for my concentration in addition to two majors".  In many cases, I was not aware that the student had declared a concentration in addition to their two majors. I see from the concentration declaration form that a student's major advisor(s) need not be consulted for their declaration.  Since the declaration of a concentration affects a student's four-year plan, I think all of their advisors should sign off.  (We might even require the signature of the chair(s) of their major department(s), as in the declaration of a second major.)  I'd also recommend that an updated four-year plan be included in the declaration. I believe this kind of policy is the purview of Curriculum Committee. I ask CC to consider updating the requirements for concentration declaration to require that all such declarations include (a) signatures of their advisors and (b) a revised four-year plan.  I assume that such a proposal must then go to the faculty. If such a policy is not in the purview of CC, please let me know where I should more appropriately address the request. I wonder if the request will get any traction.  It really is strange that we treat concentrations so differently than majors in the declaration process. I've also realized that I should make students put their four-year  plan in Self Service [12] when they declare a major so that I can access that plan at all times and see when they decide to change it. [1] I have reworded the message and eliminated some identifying details. [2] Problem one.  Students know I don't like to be addressed in the generic. [3] Problem two.  That's a special topics course.  It's unlikely to ever be offered again. [4] I'm not sure how many more problems that counts as. [5] Now that I look at it in a fresh light, I realize that they really only need three more courses for the CS major. [6] Grinnell doesn't have minors.  Concentrations serve as our alternative to minors.  They tend to be in more interdisciplinary areas, like  Technology Studies [7], Global Development Studies, and Peace and Conflict Studies [8].  But we also have some in more traditional disciplines, such as Statistics. [7] Soon to be renamed.  We don't yet know what the new name will be. [8] No, not all of the concentrations end in "Studies".

I really do plan to step back.  I've resigned two positions, including one that required me to be at faculty meetings, for just that reason. [12] Our online course planning system.
