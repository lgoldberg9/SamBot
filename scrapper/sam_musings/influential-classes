I'm not sure why, but this morning when I woke up, my muse suggested that I think about the classes I took in college [1] and beyond that have had the most long-term impact on me.  That seems like an interesting exercise in memory [2].  So, let's see ... In my first year at UofC [3], I took Analysis in Rn with Paul Sally. That class impacted me in multiple ways.  I learned that although I was a good mathematician, I was not a great mathematician.  On the first exam, I got an 83.  Believe it or not, but that was the third highest grade on the exam.  That sounds good, until you realize that the exam was out of 150.  I will admit that I don't remember much of the content of the course, except that Prof. Sally worked hard on helping us learn to prove things.  Most importantly, though, I learned an active teaching style. I also heard some of my favorite comments about testing and grading styles [4,5,6], comments I use when prompted.  I wish I remember what book we used; all I remember was that it was from Yellow Pig press [7], and that may be a false memory. In my first year at UofC, I also took the Self, Culture, and Society sequence.  I don't remember everyone who taught that course.  I know that William C. Wimsatt taught my discussion section one semester, that a visitor from Russia taught my discussion section another semester, and that Janellen Huttenlocher ran some of the lectures.  The discussion sections of that course were almost certainly where I learned to argue closely about texts.  Reading Freud and Kuhn was quite useful in shaping my understanding of the world.  Small things in various parts of the class also made a difference.  Our visitor from Russia had a huge vocabulary, but it was from reading.  So, for at least a year, I pronounced "paradigm" as if it ended with "dig-'em" rather than "dime".  I should have learned to filter more.  At some point in a lecture, I raised my hand and said, "No, Janellen, you're wrong [8,9]." In my second year at UofC, I took my first CS course.  I think it was with Stu Kurtz.  We learned about CS, using the Lisp programming language, from SICP [10].  That's the course that helped me learn that I wanted to be a computer scientist.  Starting with Lisp also helped form my approach to CS; I remain a functional programmer (at least in that I think in terms of higher-order procedures and functions as first-class values). Although I tend to be more on the software construction side of computer science, my upper-level theory sequence was incredibly influential.  I loved (and still love) thinking about the P vs. NP divide and considering how you show that a problem is NP-complete.  I also like thinking about how you  explain various parts of that theory.  Garey and Johnson [11] and the Loom book [14] have respected places on my bookshelves. Between college and graduate school, I took five or so different film classes with Gerald Mast.  In some sense, those were my opportunity to learn to study a kind of literature closely.  I'm sure that the poststructuralists have dismissed Mast's approach to film, but I appreciate the ways in which he helped me read a film closely [16]. Mast also challenged me to think better and to write better.  I don't have my papers from my film classes anymore, but I remember a regular comment of "These are interesting ideas; I wish you could express them well." Mast's criticisms led me to take Little Red Schoolhouse [17] with Joe Williams and a slew of other people [18].  That course taught me how to write competently.  It also taught me how to edit well.  When I have the time and inclination, I apply all of Williams' principles to my writing, and I find that I write much better.  But even when I don't have the time and inclination to carefully edit my writing, I benefit from his emphasis on emphasizing actors and actions.  I use his Style: Toward Clarity and Grade whenever I teach Tutorial [19,20].  Perhaps most importantly, taking this course allowed me to get the following comment from Mast: "It's nice to see that your writing has finally reached the level of your ideas. A- [21]." More recently, Jeremy Chen's Sculpture helped me learn a lot about how to approach creative works.  I appreciate the opportunity to spend so much time making art.  But I also appreciate the ways in which Chen encouraged us to support each other and how he helped me consider the relationship between making works and studying the works of others. I have also learned a lot from teaching my own courses; from talking to colleagues; from workshops, seminars, retreats, and boot camps; from reading books on my own; and more.  But if I was called upon to choose the courses that most impacted how I think, these courses are the clear leaders [22].   [1] More precisely, The College. [2] Or, in some cases, lack of memory. [3] The University of Chicago.  At some point, people started calling it UChicago, but we were UofC when I was there.  They'd only partially gutted the common core at that point, too. [4] "You want me to scale the exams?  I can scale exams.  I'll scale them down the stairs.  The stair your exam lands on determines your grade." [5] "Do you really want a multiple choice test?  Okay, the first question will read 'Which of the following proofs is correct?'" [6] Both quotations are approximate. [7] Or maybe Flying Pig Press. [8] Yeah, in that class, I was probably one of those students you hate to have in class, whether you are a professor or a fellow student. [9] Mom and Huttenlocher were friends.  I'd learned to call her by her first name before I took the class. [10] Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.  I keep thinking we should do a reading  group on that book at Grinnell. [11] Michael R. Garey and David S. Johnson (1979).  Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness. [12] [12] I wonder what people use instead of Garey and Johnson these days. [14] John E. Hopcroft and Jeffrey D. Ullman (1979).  Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation. [15] [15] I think people use Sipser instead these days. [16] I don't usually apply all of the things I learned from Mast, but it's nice to know that I can. [17] Also known as Graduate and Professional Writing. [18] I'll admit that I don't remember whether or not Williams helped teach it that semester; I think so, but it has been nearly thirty years. [19] I'm sad to see that it's out of print.  Fortunately, I think I have a big enough stash for my next Tutorial. [20] I'd love to have someone write software that reads through my writing and applies Williams-style analysis to it.  Such software would be much more helpful to me than Grammarly. [21] I think I have that paper in my files somewhere.  I hope to find it again before I retire.  If I recall correctly, it was on the role of physical comedy in the American Musical.  I noted that most of the successful musicals had at least one piece that used the tropes of  physical comedy and analyzed a variety of examples.  I think Mast noted that I actually had come up with something novel. [22] There are also probably a few others I've missed.
