As most of you who use Facebook know, Facebook regularly populates your page with "Your memories on Facebook" [1,2].  Since most of my Facebook postings are links to my musings, it's an interesting way to see what I was thinking about a year prior. A few days ago, I mused about being a workaholic, the first in a series about my workaholism.  What had I written a year previously?  I'd been complaining about captioning on the pioneers.grinnell.edu Web site [3]. The complaints were useful; the videos got captioned better. But that's not what I'm musing about today.    The captioning complaint was musing #226.  The workaholic reflection was musing #536.  While it's cool that I'd written over 300 additional musings in the intervening time, it appears that I only wrote 310 musings in exactly one year. Weren't these supposed to be daily musings?  If so, what happened to the other 55 [6]?  I knew that I'd missed a few days, particularly when I was overwhelmed with work, but I hadn't realized that it was so many. Seeing how much I'd missed expressed in such a concrete number was stunning. Let's hope that when musing #536 is a year old, I'll be on musing #901 [7,8]. Postscript: Why did I pick that particular pair of musings?  Because it's when I "did the math" about the difference.  I sketched this musing when I discovered the issue.  Then I set it aside for a few days until I had time to edit it [11]. [1] At least it regularly populates my pages with those "memories". [2] It also likes to give me notices like "You and X have been friends on Facebook for N years.  Wish them a Happy Friendiversary!"  Sometimes I even do.  But I don't share the stupid photo. [3] I love the student photos on that site.  But I hate that whenever I go to the site, I get a popup that says "Please remove your ad blocker for a better experience."  I'm sorry, but if you're doing something that sets off the ad blocker, it's you, not me, who should change.  And I really think someone needs to do a manual accessibility check, rather than relying on tools that might, say, ignore all the JavaScript-created content [4]. [4] It's fascinating trying to look at http://pioneers.grinnell.edu with Lynx.  There are a bunch of links [5] and, um, nothing else.  Is that really equivalent? [5] But no "Skip to body link". [6] Just in case that wasn't clear: There are 365 days in a year.  I mused 310 times.  365-310 is 55.  I'm therefore missing fifty-five  daily musings. [7] 536 + 365 = 901, at least if I can still add correctly. [8] There have been periods in which I posted more than one musing in a day.  I don't plan to return to that habit.  When I have the energy to write more than one musing, I leave the second [9] as something to rework on a future day [10]. [9] and the third, and the fourth, and .... [10] That's what happened with this musing.  Amazingly, when I edit and update a musing, I seem to make more changes than I expected.  In this particular case, I cleaned up some language in the main body and then found that I more than doubled the number of endnotes. [11] Or, more precisely, until an evening in which I did not have a lot of time to muse and thought that cleaning up a drafted musing would be faster than writing a new one [12]. [12] See endnote number 10 for a note on why it was still not a quick process.
