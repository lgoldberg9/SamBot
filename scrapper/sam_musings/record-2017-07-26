I'm posting five musings tonight, including this one, and wrote six today [1].  I think that sets a record.  Of course, given that I am releasing them after midnight, it's unlikely that anyone will read them.  Oh well; maybe someone will stumble upon them in the future. I don't think I'll try to beat this record any time soon.  But maybe I'll come up with others.  Longest musing?  Smallest percentage of vowels? Most footnotes?  Ooh!  I could have an awards musing!  "Day with the most musings goes to July 26, 2017."  "Musing with the most footnotes goes to ...."  It could be fun.  I've added it as a subject for my list of potential musings. But still, it's fun to have written six in a day, even if most are short and at least one is pointless.. [1] The sixth was another critique of student misuse of Yammer. But I realized that my rant was even less professional than the students' behavior, if such a thing is possible.  Hence, I will not be posting that musing.
