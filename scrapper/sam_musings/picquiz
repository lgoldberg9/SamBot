I have a large array of learning goals for CSC 151, our introductory course.  Here are a few.  I want to help students to develop some ways of thinking like a computer scientist.  I want to help them understand and be able to use various techniques, including recursion and assorted higher-order approaches.  I want to help them learn a large subset of Scheme [1].  I want to help students learn how to think on their feet and get comfortable asking questions. Some learning goals are experiential.  In particular, I want students to get used to working with a variety of other people with different skill sets, approaches, and levels of commitment.  I also want students to meet a wider variety of other students.  Hence, I regularly switch partners for daily labs [2]. Because I want students to get to know each other, at some point in the semester, I give a "picture quiz" in which I list all of the students' names, present all of the students' pictures in some unknown order [3], and ask students to identify all of their classmates [4,8].  Sometimes I give it as early as week four to really encourage students to learn each others' names [9].  Sometimes I give it right before break as a slightly less stressful [10] quiz. Some students love the quiz.  Some hate it [11].  It values a different kind of skill and knowledge than the other quizzes I give, which tend to focus more on concepts from computer science, programming, or Scheme. Since knowing other students is one of my learning goals for the course, I consider it reasonable to test students in this way.  I know some find it hard; I've had at least a few who didn't even identify themselves.  But, as I said, giving the quiz makes an important rhetorical statement.  It also leads to some amusing review sessions [12]. I've been giving this quiz for about a decade now [14].  Maybe it's time for a new quiz that reinforces the same issues.  Perhaps in the future I will hand students pictures of twelve of their classmates and ask them to say something special about ten of them.  We'll see. Wish my students luck!  Some will need it. [1] R5RS.  Knowing a large subset of R7RS and beyond is difficult. [2] We tend to switch partners twice per week. [3] Student pictures used to have an associated number.  I would usually organize by that number.  Student pictures no longer have that associated number, so I find other approaches. [4] CSC 151 is one of the largest classes at Grinnell, with 36 to 40 students in the course most of the time that I teach it [5]. [5] Yes, 36 to 40 is very large for Grinnell.  It's small compared to other introductory courses, even at some small colleges.  I have heard that Harvey Mudd has a few hundred in theirs [6]. [6] Rumor has it that by teaching such large sections of CS, Zachary  Dodds is personally responsible for dropping the Harvey Mudd US News rankings by a few points [7]. [7] Yes, that's absurd.  But much about the US News rankings are absurd. [8] They can still get a full ten points (out of ten) if they miss 10% of their classmates.  Additional credit is available if they get everyone right and if they do other related tasks. [9] And to encourage myself to learn everyone's name. [10] Or at least differently stressful. [11] Eldest son hated that I asked for first names, given that he'd memorized last names. [12] We usually don't do review sessions for the picture quiz.  But one semester, one of the class mentors made flash cards. [14] Yes, I use different pictures each semester.
