The other day, someone said something like the following to me.   I read your 'blog, but I don't read the footnotes. I have three responses to that statement. They are endnotes, not footnotes [1,3]. I find that choice strange, since the endnote section, or the interaction between the primary text and the endnotes, is probably the best part of my writing. You do know that I provide easy-to-follow links, don't you [4,5]? Of course, it is up to my readers how you read.  But please use the correct name for the endnotes [6]. [1] If you print the site, they appear at the end of each musing, not at the bottom of each page [2].  That makes them endnotes not footnotes. [2] They appear on the last page of a multipage musing.  The appear in the middle of a page when I write short musings like this one and print multiple short musings on one page. [3] Counter-argument: It's a Web page.  They appear in the footer of the  Web page.  They are therefore footnotes. [4] Yes, I know that some readers read the whole text and then the  footnotes.  I still don't quite understand how that works. [5] I even spent some of my precious coding time making those links auto-generate. [6] You may also call them "end notes" if you prefer.
