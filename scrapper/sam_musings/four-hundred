This musing is number 400, at least under the numbering system that I seem to be using.  It's strange, I was so excited when I reached musing 100.  I had musings that led up to it.  I asked my readers to suggest favorites.  I mused about the achievement [1,2] Here we are, three hundred musings later, and it doesn't fell like nearly the event.  Why not?  I don't know.  I've become less fond of celebrating multiples of five or ten.  Now that I am far beyond 100, completing  another musing, or another fity musings, no longer represents the same pinnacle of achievement that I've felt in the past.  Rather, it's just a small stage in a much longer journey. What's different?  At one-hundred musings, it wasn't clear that I would continue to write and, given that I stopped for the summer after musing  forty, it seemed unlikely that I would continue.  At this point, I have enough topics to write about and enough of a writing habit" that it's likely that I will continue. Will I celebrate 500 musings?  One thousand?  Maybe for the first queston. Almost certinly for the second (partial) question.  Stay tuned to find out. [1] Those musings were relatively short. [2] At the time, I called them "essays" rather than "musings".  Is tat
