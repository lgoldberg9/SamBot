Sam, what happened to your 'blog? That's a good question.  I'm nearing the first anniversary of nearly daily musings.  And then, suddenly, five straight days passed in which I posted nothing.  What happened?  Well, the start of the semester happened [1].  It's not that I didn't have things to write about. I did.  It's not that I wasn't writing.  I was.  It's that classes started Thursday and I was even further behind than I usually was in preparing for those classes.  So getting classes ready took priority. It didn't help that unexpected things came up at home [2] and at work [3].  It didn't help that I felt like I was making enough progress in straightening my lab that I sometimes did that rather than work I needed to do.  Hence, when I finished my work each night and I asked myself, "Should I muse or should I go to bed?", the answer was obvious. This semester is crazy busy.  The first day of classes reminded me just how crazy and busy it's going to be.  And I've promised Michelle that I will take on more responsibilities at home as she nears the home stretch of completing her MBA.  But I really need to continue to muse. I'm just going to shoot for shorter musings, like this one.  We'll see if I succeed. Now, I just have to catch up on missed musings .... [1] The Eclipse also happened, but that's a story for another musing. [2] Needing a new water heater doesn't top the list. [3] Even though my nine-month contract does not start until the first day of classes, there are many things that I'm called on to do before that day.  I also spent a lot of time talking to students about CSC151 and CS in general.
