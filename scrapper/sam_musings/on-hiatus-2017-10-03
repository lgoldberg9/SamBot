I love musing. But I'm lying to myself and to you if I claim that I can do this every day. Any time I have should be going to catching up on my work or spending time with my family. So, as much as I hate to say it, SamRs assorted musings and rants is now officially on hiatus. Maybe I can muse a bit during fall break.
