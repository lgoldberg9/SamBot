One of my many professional tasks is to co-run the mailing lists for SIGCSE, one of my professional organizations.  A few weeks after the 2018 SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, I heard indirectly from someone who had joined SIGCSE when they registered for SIGCSE [1] and wanted to be added to the mailing lists.  And then I thought to myself "there must be others".  So I wrote to the registration team to get the list of new members.  I quickly learned that there were a few hundred new SIGCSE members [2].  So I did what any reasonable mailing list moderator would do.  So I sent a mass email [3] explaining the two lists and inviting people to join the lists.  I probably should have asked my advisory board first [4]. As you might expect, many responded.  Not all, because not everyone wants to be on mailing lists and because some of the new members were student members, including undergraduates.  I expect that most undergraduates  don't really want to see what CS faculty discuss on their mailing list. But even with fewer, I now had new work to do. Why did I make more work for myself?  Because it's the right thing to do. But it also made my life easier.  Normally, when someone asks to join the mailing lists, I have to check the database.  The database is slow. Then I have to go to the listserv Web site and copy and paste their data. Then I have to compose a reply.  In this case, the first things I did were to (a) open the Web site and leave it open and (b) set my mail signature to be the template for a message to the effect that "I have subscribed you" [5].  That made the whole "add a new member" task much quicker.  Let's see ... Copy email address.  Paste it on Web page for SIGCSE-members.  Click "Add".  Switch to the Web page for SIGCSE-announce. Paste.  Click "Add".  Hit "Reply".  Quickly edit the template.  Send. Yup, I can do all of that in under a minute and a half. How many did I add?  44 within six hours of sending the message.  31 over the next few days.  A few have already posted messages to the listserv [6].  One has already left; they had not anticipated as many messages as the mailing list generates [7]. Did I make more work for myself?  Probably.  I spent about two hours this past week on adding new members.  But we now have 75 [8] new members on the list.  They benefit from the list.  They list will benefit from them.  It's worth my time.  And it's part of my job [9]. What's next?  When I have a spare moment [10], I plan to work with some of the SIGCSE board on crafting an appropriate "Welcome to SIGCSE" message.  What new members get right now does not suffice. [1] That is, they joined the professional society when they registered for the conference.  It's not my fault that the two things have the same name. [2] 563 to be exact. [3] Did you know that our mailer gets upset if you try to send email to more than 500 addresses at once?  I didn't.  But I learned.  So then I split them into two lists, each with the same messages. [4] I'll explain my advisory board in a future musing. [5] Some time I'll write about how I use signatures to manage the templates for email messages that I regularly send. [6] Members can only post to SIGCSE-members. [7] I think we average about three per day, but they clearly come in clumps.  Some messages are announcements and pass by.  Others ask a question or raise a controversial issue (e.g., when to teach recursion or relationships with the IT department); those tend to generate a lot of dialog in the day, but then die down. [8] 74, with the one person who unsubscribed. [9] Not my "Professor of Computer Science at Grinnell College" job but instead my "SIGCSE mailing list moderator" job. [10] That is, in seven weeks or so. [11] This endnote has no antecedent.  I've just added it so that I have a place to add a comment.  I'm not sure about my choice to start four paragraphs in a row with questions.  But I'm letting that choice stand because it's late and this musing is not about a substantive  enough topic to warrant significant editing.
