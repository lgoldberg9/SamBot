The most common comment I hear from Raynard Kington, Grinnell's president: "Sam, is everything okay?  You haven't sent me a complaint in months!" What Paul Tymann, the AP CS Principles Chief Reader, said when he saw me this afternoon: "Sam, is everything okay?  You haven't sent me a complaint all day." Is it time for a change? On a somewhat related note, we heard today that we are not supposed to post anything to social media about the reading, not even what performance task we are grading.  Fortunately, I haven't posted that information [1]. But isn't that limit a bit excessive?  It's not like I'm posting publicly the concerns that I have repeatedly rasied with Paul. [1] Or at least I don't think I have.
