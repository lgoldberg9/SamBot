Number five in a series. I realize that almost everyone is bored with this series by now. Nonetheless, I'm going to continue it for a bit longer so that I have a record not only of how I am spending my time, but also my reflections on that time spent.  Perhaps I'll find them useful when I reflect back in a year or five.  We'll start with the data. wilson  10       0:10   Work on Wilson committee material tec154  20       0:20   Think about TEC 154, which I'm teaching this week clean   45       0:45   Straighten my office and/or lab glimmer 50       0:50   Work on my research rec     100      1:40   Write letters of recommendation admin   130      2:10   Administrative paperwork work    165      2:45   Other kinds of general work oh      255      4:15   Meet with students in office hours musing  380      6:20   Write these things email   460      7:40   Read, write, and respond to email csc32x  585      9:45   Prepare and teach CSC 321 and CSC 322 csc151  885     14:45   Prepare, teach, and grade CSC 151 dept    990     16:30   Assorted department admin responsibilities If I total that correctly, that's about 61 hours of work.  There were a lot of extra department meetings and paperwork this past week.  One of my favorite parts was writing a last-minute addendum to a request that we've had out for four weeks.  If I could get rid of the department  work, my life would seem almost reasonable. The week started poorly.  Bot Monday and Tuesday were 13-hour days.  But the rest of the week got better.  I actually worked less than I planned to over the weekend.  The dead computer is one reason.  But I also had some unexpected [1] family obligations.   It was a week in which I had lots of things I wanted to attend.  Let's see ... I made it to two showings of The Little Mermaid [2], an Arlo Guthrie concert, and a Grinnell Singer's concert in Des Moines where I had the pleasant surprise of hearing Mark Laver accompany the Singers on soprano sax.  I also made it to both CS extras and CS table.  However, I also missed another choir concert in town [4], a play which involved my students, and both days of Erik Simpson's "Lighting the Page". My use of the time log has evolved a bit.  I've been using the time logs  to set out the expected parts of my day.  For example, I know that I'll be in class from 8:30 to 10:00 and from 2:00 to 4:00 on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  I also know that I'll be doing some class prep before those classes.  But I've started to use the time logs as a quick and dirty "to do" list; I add entries without times and then plan to fill them in later.  That approach has not worked perfectly; I'm finding that I copy some of those items from day, to day, to day. What should I take away from this week?  I need to avoid 13-hour days. Some amounts of time spent are fairly consistent; I spent about six hours per week on musing, about six or seven hours per week on email, and about ten hours per week on CSC 32x [5].  Time on CSC 151 seems to vary a lot.  Office hours vary a bit, but are generally about half of the available office hour time.  Administrative work, on the other hand, varies the most significantly.  I suppose that's to be expected. This coming week, I'm guest teaching in TEC 154, the Evolution of  Technology.  We'll see how that affects my schedule. I'll be back in a week with another report.  Then it will be spring break, and I'll plan to take a few weeks off from reflecting on how I'm spending my time.  But for now, I plan to report back next week. See you then! [1] But pleasant. [2] Youngest Son was a sailor, a water spirit, and master carpenter [3]. [3] Two of those are roles in the play.  One reflects his work before the play started. [4] Knox or something like that. [5] That number is likely to change as the structure of the course changes for the second half of the semester.  I expect some variation as large parts of projects or other assignments come in.
