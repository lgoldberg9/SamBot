It's fall break at Grinnell College.  Last week, I told my students that I don't quite get fall break.  The part I love most about my job is being in the classroom with students.  And that's the part of my job that I get a break from.  Instead, I get to spend fall break grading, doing paperwork, preparing classes for after break [1], doing more paperwork, trying to make my various environments habitable, and so on and so forth.  But that's okay, getting those things done will likely make my time after break a bit better. I will admit that I tend to enter fall break optimistically: While I have many things to do, I am convinced that I can do them.  Then the end of  fall break hits and I wonder where the time has gone and why I didn't get things done.  This fall break is different: I know that I have so much that I need to or want to do that there's no way that I can do it all. Unfortunately, that knowledge is not particularly freeing. So, what do I have to do this break?  I don't have a complete list, but I know a lot.  There's the big paperwork: I have a ten-page-or-so review to write and another ten-page-or-so review to review.  Both have about fifty pages of accompanying data and documentation to read.  I need to get my CV and Sedona documents up to date and write statements for my triennial salary review.  I have a policy to update and some outstanding issues to ask about.   In terms of grading, I have the second exam in CSC 151 [2], a bit of cleanup on the first exam for CSC 301, a bunch of outstanding CSC 301 homework assignments, the final grades for CSC 321, a few bits and pieces for CSC 151, and likely something else that I've forgotten. We've added a new unit on program verification to CSC 301 this year. I need to prepare that new unit [4].  I also need to write the readings and labs for two or so weeks of CSC 151 [5].  I also need to design and write the new project description. I'm hoping to start musing again.  It looks like I have a list of topics that are appropriate for this time of year, some of which I've already started to write about.  I'll see how that goes. What else?  Oh, yeah.  I need to make my spaces cleaner.  That includes straightening my work office and my lab and my home office.  Our house has fallen apart a bit this semester, so I should use some time to work more broadly on the house.  And I still haven't gotten things together after the crash of my music backup drive [10].  I have a new backup strategy in mind that involves cloning my backup drives, but they need to be organized first. There are also some professional responsibilities.  I need to get a database up and running for the SIGCSE volunteers project.  I probably need to work on the Web site for SIGCAS.  I have some shorter reviews to write. I've left out many of the smaller tasks, such as updating some policies, getting data to the registrar [11], and so on and so forth.  I'm not even sure they are written down any where.   And, of course, I should try to have some fun. So, what have I done in the first three days and one evening of break? Friday night, I helped eldest son pack for his move.  Saturday, I worked on getting my files organized a bit better.  I clearly have a lot more to go; I may not be able to get everything done this break. Sunday, I wrote most of the materials for my triennial salary review and started on the longer review I had to write.  Oh, yeah, I watched Kumail Nanjiani on SNL and binge watched The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt [12].  Monday [14], I continued to work on the longer review and spent a lot of time attempting to straighten my work office [15].  I also got lots of trash out from phase one of eldest cleaning out his room.  And I wrote this musing. Should I plan what I'm doing each of the following days?  Tuesday I should continue on the long review, start grading the CSC 151 exams, and spend an hour or so on my lab.  I think I'll leave it open what I do on Wednesday and beyond.   But I will also try to muse each day.   [1] Okay, I like preparing classes, too. [2] Let's see ... six questions plus paperwork [3].  About five minutes per questions.  70 exams.  Yup, that's a whole week worth's of work all by itself. [3] Totaling grades, adding in extra credit, recording it in the gradebook, sending the graded exam to the student, etc. [4] I normally have to prepare old units, too.  But new topics take more time. [5] Let's see ... debugging [6], randomness and simulation [7], pairs and pair structures, vectors, trees [8], higher-order procedures [9], and files. [6] No, write statements do not count. [7] That probably needs some expansion for the new version of CSC 151. [8] I need a new application of trees. [9] Revisited.  I hope they are excited to write map, reduce, filter, and other procedures they've been using for the semester. [10] It doesn't help that every time I try to copy a file with a bad block, the computer freezes for five to fifteen minutes.  rsync helps, but things are still slow. [11] I also have to find the sheets that contain the data for the registrar. That's worrisome. [12] Don't ask.  I was looking for something light to watch while trying to organize the hard drive and got a bit too hooked. [14] That's today. [15] I have a floor!
