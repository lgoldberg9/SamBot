At about 11:00 p.m. last night, I posted my latest musing in the nibbled to death by ducks series.  At about 12:30 a.m., I received a message from Facebook with the title "[Bulk Mail] Reader Name commented on the link you shared."  What was the comment?   Sounds wonderful. My first reaction?  "You think my workload sounds wonderful?  Really? And I thought I was snarky!" But it seemed unlikely that this reader would make such a snarky  comment and so I clicked the "Show on Facebook" button.  It turns out that they were behind in reading and were actually commenting on  my code camp article. I still like the original interpretation, though.
