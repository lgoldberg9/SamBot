I've been making some bad choices recently.  The most extreme was the all nighter on Friday night to finish some papers.  I'm clearly too old for all nighters [1].  That's a large bad choice. Here's a small one.  Tonight, I decided to do some work in my office. But when I do work in my office, students see me and ask questions. Some of the questions were a lot of fun.  For example, I enjoyed helping students think through an inductive proof [2], even though I gave some bad advice along the way [3].  And I even enjoyed helping a slew of CSC 151 students with an assortment of problems. But, well, when I'm helping students individually, I'm not getting my other work done.  So, while I had fun helping students, I did not get Friday's CSC 151 reading written, nor did I get my Tuesday morning classes prepped, nor did I get all of the course Web site cleanup done. Oh well.  Back to working from home. When I added the "pithy summary" to the index page, I found myself writing the following.   Helping students rather than writing stuff.  Is that really such a   bad choice? I thought it belonged in this musing. [1] All nighters are not a good idea for anyone.  But bad planning sometimes leads to the need for them, at least in my case.
