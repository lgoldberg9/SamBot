# CSC213-FinalProject

This repository contains our scripts and project details for the chatbot
script we made for CSC-213.

In each of the folders, we have the following contents:

* The **chatroom** folder contains the chat script and the chatbots files.
* The **LDA_script** folder contains LDA script we used to train on Sam's musings.
* The **web_scrapper** folder contains the web scrapper script that gathers Sam's musings from his website.
* The **mallet_setup** folder contains the script needed to initialize a given chatbot.
* The **mallet** folder contains the necessary binaries to run Mallet.

All the scripts are written using Python 2.7 and have not been updated for
compatability to Python 3.0. Required installation of nltk, wordnet, spacy, pyLDAvis, and gensim to local user directory.
